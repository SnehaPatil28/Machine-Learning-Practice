# Machine-Learning-Practice
	This repository is a hands-on collection of core machine learning experiments, covering the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation using classic algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Naive Bayes classifiers. It is designed to help beginner learners systematically practice and compare different models on real datasets, building strong intuition about when and how to use each technique in practical scenarios.

What this repo offers
	End-to-end notebooks and scripts that start from raw data, apply cleaning, encoding, and scaling steps, and then train and evaluate multiple ML models on the same problem.​

	Clear, experiment-style organization where each folder or notebook focuses on one algorithm (e.g., logistic regression vs. KNN vs. SVM) so you can observe performance, strengths, and 		limitations side by side.​

	Practical examples of both supervised learning (classification and regression) and unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction) using standard Python ML libraries.​
